      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
      I've always been fascinated about technology, engineering, and science in general.  I've been fascinated about electrical circuits, electromagnetism, electronics, and computers, primarily programming.  My earliest experiences with tech would be in designing routines for TI-8x series graphing calculators.  My math teacher had us enter a pre-written series of steps to find answers to given problems. Instead of following the laborious steps described by my math teacher, I made routines on the calculator that enabled me to just enter my input, and it would provide me with the correct output.  All of our calculators in class were numbered. I always made sure that I was one of the first to get a calculator so that I could choose the one that I had written the routines on.  </p>

<p>I also attended the Governor's School for Science & Math summer camp, where I designed Lunar Lander video games, written in Pascal, using the instructor's libraries.  I also learned enough BASIC to write a simple program for the Clemson University Physics department, and learned a little bit of IDL. None of those languages (Pascal, BASIC, or IDL do I recall by the way.)</p>

<p>COVID provided the perfect opportunity for me to switch careers and start my web and mobile app development journey.  It also provided valuable lessons on work-life balance, how important and critical that aspect of my life is, and how the occupation I choose to pursue must offer that level of flexibility.
The tech industry provides me with the means to do just that while allowing me to work in a sector that I'm passionate about and that allows me to give back to others.</p>

<p>What I look for in a career opportunity is a position that allows for personal and professional growth, development, and advancement while allowing me to engage in projects that I'm passionate about, to work on projects that make a positive difference in the lives of others, and that provides the necessary work-life balance and flexibility. I would like to work as a full stack engineer in web/mobile app development for a learning organization that provides just that.</p>
